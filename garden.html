        <h2>So will the garden wither?</h2>
        <p>The man had a garden and two sons. He called the first one and said:<br>
            - Take care of the garden.<br>
            And he answered:<br>
            - Yes, sure Father. I love this garden and will be happy to take care of it.<br>
            But after a conversation with his father, he became lazy and decided not to take care of the garden. The father called the second son and said:<br>
            - Take care of the garden.<br>
            In response:<br>
            - I won't do it for anything, I'm disgusted and not interested in him.<br>
            After the conversation, the son thought that it would still be a pity if the garden withered, and reluctantly began to take care of it.<br>
            <br>
            So will the garden wither?
